## Acknowledgments 
Special thank you to the following individuals whose websites I shamelessly borrowed formatting and ideas from:

* [Dr. Siavash Mirarab](http://eceweb.ucsd.edu/~smirarab/)
* [Dr. Melissa Gymrek](http://gymreklab.github.io/)
* [Dr. Jean Fan](http://jef.works/)

Also thank you to Khan Academy for providing me with all the knowledge of HTML and CSS.

And thank YOU for looking at this code. Feel free to use, copy/paste it, or do anything your little heart desires with it.
